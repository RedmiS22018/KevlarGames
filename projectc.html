        Days after IBIS Corp lost all contact with its research facility, a rival company formed a small team of experts to infiltrate the location. Their primary objective is to gather any Intel that could be used against IBIS and expose them for their unethical practice on human test subjects.  
        The team, codename Echo Five, enters the facility with little issues, finding the inside to be practically falling apart. There are no IBIS personnel on sight, not even a corpse. Echo Five soon spots an ominous blood trail leading into a dark room. The team follows the trail to an animal containment room, where they are ambushed by grotesque creatures. Overrun by monsters, the team makes an attempt to retreat out of the facility, but the floor collapses underneath them and they all fall into the dark abyss.
        Tanner, Echo Five's disease expert, wakes up hours later inside a dark room under freezing temperature. Alone and ill-equipped, Tanner must regroup with his squad and escape the facility. What was supposed to be an in-and-out job becomes a matter of survival, and for Tanner, it is now a suicide mission to search for his wife who could be anywhere in the facility.
